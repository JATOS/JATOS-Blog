JATOS 3 is out and it got some nice security improvements that I want to talk about in more detail in this post.

First and most important is the better user session handling (don't confuse user session with batch or group session - the first one is responsible for a authentication of a user in JATOS.
- user session (don't confuse with batch/group session)


- account lockout
- encrypted session cookie
- security headers
- restrict /jatos to intranet
