There is a really easy way to [embed Google Slides](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/183965) in your JATOS component's HTML file. I thought that this might be a quick way to write the instructions for an experiment. They aren't the most beautiful way to present instructions (the Google Slides frame is always visible) but it's quick, easy, versatile, and allows your participants to move forwards and backwards on the series of instructions slides.

To see the instructions you need to be online but that is usually not a problem with online studies :)

I included an [example](http://www.jatos.org/Example-Studies.html#easy-instruction-page-with-embedded-google-slides) in our Example Studies page.
