**Update: Unfortunatly Dply closed down and can't be used any more to get an JATOS server.**

I wrote a blog post about [how to get a JATOS server via Dply.co](http://blog.jatos.org/JATOS-with-Dply/) and I still like this little service quite a lot. It's super easy to set up a server and at least initially it's for free. I did a new Dply button that this time uses JATOS' Docker container:

[![Dply](https://dply.co/b.svg)](https://dply.co/b/zkSCX6Cx) 

Remember it takes a while for JATOS to be installed on the server. I had to wait around 2 min, but it probably depends on the cloud vendor.
