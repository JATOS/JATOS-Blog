We noticed that can be difficult for people who have never heard of JATOS to understand what JATOS actually is and what it can do for them. So we started with a little series of introduction videos. We planned 3 parts so far. First one is [youtu.be/H1tR8gPt6bA](https://youtu.be/H1tR8gPt6bA). I hope you like it (I'm a programmer and not an entertainer - so please be gentle with me).
