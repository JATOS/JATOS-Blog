JATOS tries to make running online experiments easy. But one difficult part remains: get a JATOS server in the Internet.

Now there is this simple tutorial, 
[JATOS on DigitalOcean](http://www.jatos.org/JATOS-on-DigitalOcean.html), that aims at people who know a little about computers but don't feel comfortable with server administration or the 'cloud'. If everything works as it should, you won't even need to use a terminal. It uses the cloud provider DigitalOcean that in itself is easy to use.

The [first part](http://www.jatos.org/JATOS-on-DigitalOcean.html#setup-a-simple-jatos-server-on-digitalocean) describes how to set up a simple JATOS server.

Then, in the [second part](http://www.jatos.org/JATOS-on-DigitalOcean.html#add-https-with-traefik-and-use-your-own-domain-name), it continues with adding HTTPS and using your own domain name through [Traefik](https://traefik.io/).
