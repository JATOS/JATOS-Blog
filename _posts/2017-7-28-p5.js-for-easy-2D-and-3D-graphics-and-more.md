title: p5.js for easy 2D and 3D graphics and more

I liked to used [Processing](https://processing.org/) for Java. With Processing I could do beautiful graphics and this without actually having to understand this complicated OpenGL. Originally Processing was meant for data visualization like [this one from Ben Fry](http://benfry.com/valence/) (Ben Fry and Casey Reas are also the initial creators). But soon it was used by all sorts of people like artists, scientists, and professionals alike. 

So I was excited to hear that there is a port of Processing for JavaScript: [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). Have a look at the [examples on the p5.js webpage](https://p5js.org/examples/) to get an idea of what is possible.

Some features are:

* 2D and 3D shapes (including bezier curves and polygons)
* Image calculations
* Video and sound support
* Webcam or mic capture
* Math helper function
* Interaction with mouse and keyboard
* Particle systems
* Basic physics

Another example of what one can do is [net-glimpse](https://github.com/kristian-lange/net-glimpse) (coincidentally written by me) which uses p5.js for the visualization of network traffic in the browser.

Since p5.js is JavaScript and runs completely in the browser it's possible to combine it with JATOS: I added an [example study with p5.js for JATOS](http://www.jatos.org/Example-Studies.html#interactive-2d3d-graphics-with-p5js-library). So if you need some comparatively easy to program graphics in your online experiments p5.js is a good choice.
